# Try Hack Me - Squid Game

**Categories:** Security, blue team, maldoc  
**Difficulty:** Hard  

This is not a traditional boot2root CTF; the room provides 5 .doc files for malware analysis, increasing in complexity / difficulty. Given the length of the analysis and the code snippets, each guide is presented separately (see links to each guide below).  

These guides use the [REMNux malware analysis distro](https://remnux.org/), but all of the tools used in these guides are available on the browser-based machine provided in the Try Hack Me room.
